# Icons

Icons are ideal as a visual support for the different actions. You should rarely, if ever, use icons as stand alone.

Install: `yarn add '@modal/icons`

Usage: `import { CloseIcon } from '@modal/icons';`

## Available icons

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Icons">
    <BellIcon width="6em" />
    <CheckIcon width="6em" />
    <CloseIcon width="6em" />
    <EmbedIcon width="6em" />
    <InfoIcon width="6em" />
    <LinkIcon width="6em" />
    <WarningIcon width="6em" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Accessibility

By default, icons are considered decorative, and as such they are hidden from the accessibility tree using `aria-hidden`. Therefore, if you're using an icon as standalone where its meaning is lost to assistive technologies, such as the sole child of a button, an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute must be passed to the icon itself. This will remove the `aria-hidden` attribute from the icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Accessible icon">
    <CheckIcon width="6em" aria-label="Check me out" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
