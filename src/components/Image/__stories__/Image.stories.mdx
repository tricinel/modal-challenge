# Image

`<Image />` is used to insert and display an image within a section.

Install: `yarn add '@modal/image`

Usage: `import Image from '@modal/image';`

## Src and srcSet

The `<Image />` component requires the `src` for the image in the form of either a local path or an external URL.

  <Story name="Image with src">
    <Image
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

At the same time, you can pass in a `srcSet` to better control which image gets displayed at which device size and orientation. For details on `srcSet`, see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset).

> In order to see the different images, please resize your browser. As you go lower than a tablet, you should see a completely different photo.

## Layouts


### Fixed

The image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fixed Image">
    <Image
      layout="fixed"
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Responsive

The image will respond to viewport changes and will scale up and down as the that changes.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Image">
    <Image
      layout="responsive"
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Fill

The image will scale up and down as the viewport changes and maintain the aspect ratio, filling the entire content box. If it does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the image will be clipped to fit.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fill Image">
    <Image
      layout="fill"
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Scale-down

The image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports but maintain the original dimensions for larger viewports.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Scale-down Image">
    <Image
      layout="scale-down"
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Accessibility

Images must have an `alt` attribute. If the image is considered decorative and should not be announced by screen readers, then set the prop to an emtpy string like `alt=""`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Accessible image">
    <Image
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?w=800&q=80"
      alt="two dogs running next to each other in the sun"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
